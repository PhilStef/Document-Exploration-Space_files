Plum claims he was going to write himself a check to cover the $200,000 Boddy stole from him, but decided against it as he didn't want to go to jail for check fraud and there was no way he could get away with writing himself a $200,000 check.  Instead, when he was leaving the estate for the night he went and grabbed his belongings from the lounge and threw the checkbook into the fireplace to at least destroy it out of spite.  Plum noted however that the checkbook had a standing balance of well over $25 Million dollars and was updated just 3 days ago.",

Upon hearing this source reports that Plum confessed to taking Walter Boddy's checkbook while he was sitting at the desk in the study when Adam Mustard's back was turned and they were conversing.  Plum claims he was going to write himself a check to cover the $200,000 Boddy stole from him, but decided against it as he didn't want to go to jail for check fraud and there was no way he could get away with writing himself a $200,000 check.  Instead, when he was leaving the estate for the night he went and grabbed his belongings from the lounge and threw the checkbook into the fireplace to at least destroy it out of spite.  Plum noted however that the checkbook had a standing balance of well over $25 Million dollars and was updated just 3 days ago.",

Plum wanted to know how long two people had to be married before a divorce would result in a division of shared assests between the husband and wife.  He then asked if one of the parties entering the marriage was separated from a spouse in a previous marriage, if he or she could legally enter a new marriage.  The lawyer explained to him that this would not work since a separation would not nullify the previous marriage so the party could not enter into a new marriage contract.  The lawyer further explained that once divorce papers were signed for the individual's first marriage the party could enter into a second marriage legally.  ",

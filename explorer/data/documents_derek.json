He said that as part of this exercise, information was received from a spy that terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi were present in the Old City area, and had plans to carry out another terrorists act on a forthcoming day of religious significance. <br><br>Following up on this information, Khan along with his team raided a house on G Allana Road, and after an encounter, arrested Abdul Rana ul Baqi alias Majid, Ismail and Yousuf. The house where they gathered belonged to Abdul Rana ul Baqi, while Yousuf was a resident of Shah Faisal Colony, and Ismail lived in Malir. Three TT pistols, C-4 explosives, potassium nitrate, mortar rockets, wires, detonators and other equipments used for making bombs were recovered during search, Khan said. <br><br>The suspects were subsequently taking to the Investigation Unit, where during probe, it was found that the accused belonged to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

He said that some weeks ago, they (the 3 held activists) and other activists were called at their hideout in Malir by Ameer Hasan.<br><br>They started gathering explosive materials and other items, and waited for further directions. During this period, they were told that they would use motorcycles in the blast, and they would enter the procession by wearing green turbans so as to avoid any suspicion. As per the plan, the suspects were to reach near Nishter Park, park the motorcycles there, and after moving to a prescribed range, press the remote control to set off the bomb. <br><br>The accused revealed that they had even purchased the turbans and were fully prepared for the attack, but unfortunately, the CID was tipped and they were arrested."

The three defendants’ eight-year jail sentence for was set aside by the court. A lower court had earlier convicted them of possessing government arms and selling them to foreign interests.

The claim is corroborated by Internal Security Assistant Minister Jimiyu Michieka who told The Standard on Sunday the seizure of the weapons was exposed following a deal gone sour among the merchants of death, said to include civilians and security officers. Some senior officers at the Ministry Police Training College (MPTC) interviewed point to unresolved political intrigues that relate to the retention of Ita Adoyo who should have retired last year. An inspector, who cannot be named for fear of reprisals, claims it was unusual for items to leave the armoury without the knowledge of senior officers. Even more intriguing are revelations that the force’s firearms and ammunitions records are updated daily. Requisitions from districts and units — MPTC, Security of Government Buildings, Rapid Deployment Unit and Rural Border Patrol Unit — are approved by the Force Commandant. He should be the one answering the questions about how arms ended in civilian custody as claimed, the source said.Arms acquisition, it also emerged, is steeped in corruption. What raises more questions is that the armoury is under CCTV surveillance and armed guard round the clock. Asked about how this is feasible, Michieka  said, This is a sensitive matter. I am not privy to information about how the force keeps its records or secures the armoury. From the look of things this is just a deal gone sour."

Police spokesman Abasi Gashi said yesterday that the operation has turned out very successfully.  But Gashi also noted that the operation was not complete.  “We will not conclude this operation until the bandits have all been rounded up and routed.”  <br><br>There are claims of police harassment throughout the region.  Mr. Gakere Wangai says that police has roughed up him and several others that he knows even though they are not associated with SLDF. “They broke into my house and beat me for a long time.  I kept asking them why, but they would not stop hitting me.”  A pastor who lives in the same area, reports a similar story, “I was just taking tea when officers burst in and thrashed me and my guests. I was knocked unconscious until the next day.”  <br><br>Journalists have not been allowed into the operations area, and are treated roughly by security forces.  Gashi denies that the media, or anyone else, have been harassed. "

And we can provide positive proof on how the system works and how we track how weapons and equipment are handled,\" says the source.<br><br>Force commandant, chief armourer, and chief of operations are responsible for acquiring arms. These are the officers Parliamentary Committee are most interested in if the ongoing inquiries would not resolve the riddle.<br><br>It also came to light that two weeks before the discovery of the illegal arsenal, 1,400 MP officers had been training in Ngong, about 60km from Narok, in preparation for security operations in western Kenya. If that were the case, they said, close to 500 guns are yet to be accounted for.<br><br>The officers who took part in training are currently involved in security operations in Mt Elgon to dispel banditry that has over the past three months claimed more than 120 lives.<br><br>\"Impossible.  Such a large amount of munitions and arms could not have left the  armoury without the knowledge of the commandant. In any case, our records are updated daily,\" he adds.<br><br>In a fiery exchange in Parliament on Thursday, MPs examined the confusing arrests of senior officers, with Public Accounts Committee chairman Mwaka Omondi, calling for indictment of the top brass. There is also news of a suspicious attempt to influence police investigators with offers of Sh3 million, which they rejected."
